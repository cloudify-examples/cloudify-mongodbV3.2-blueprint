* MongoDB components:
1. mongod
    mongod is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB system.
    It handles data requests,
    manages data access,
    and performs background management operations.

2. mongos
    mongos for “MongoDB Shard” is a routing service for MongoDB shard configurations that processes queries from the application layer,
    and determines the location of this data in the sharded cluster,
    in order to complete these operations.
    From the perspective of the application,
    a mongos instance behaves identically to any other MongoDB instance.

3. mongo_config
    mongo_config this mongod instance serves as the config database of a sharded cluster.
    When running with this option,
    clients (i.e. other cluster components) will not be able to write data to any database other than config and admin.
    The default port for a mongod with this option is 27019 and the default --dbpath directory is /data/configdb,
    unless specified.

Note: mongos need the mongo_config address:port in startup

Steps:
1. start the confid servers (mongo_config)
    >> mongod --congifsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path>
2. start the shard servers (mongos)
    >> mongos --configdb <mongo_config ip>:<mongo_config port>,... --port <port>
3. start the primary servers (mongod)
    >> mongod --...
